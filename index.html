        <h2>ABOUT LE BAND</h2>
        <p>

            LE BAND is the next phase in African live music. The three man group which won the Best New Artist & Best
            group Video of the Year Awards in the 2017 Pulse Music Video Awards already packs a repertoire of songs
            outlining the dynamic nature of generation finding its voice and striking all the right cords while at
            it.Fidel, Ken and Joel are shaping the future of music by tapping into its rich past and employing powerful,
            catchy lyrics and their signature rhythms indicating a continent on the verge of global explosion. With all
            three having turned away from careers considered proper in their motherland Kenya, this rebellion and
            unwavering commitment to the craft and beauty of music shows in the sort of work they have gone about
            creating. Testament to their mantra of ‘Do what you love with all you have and the rest will follow’, Le
            Band’s first track of 2018 was a runaway hit of monumental proportions. Featuring Kaligraph Jones, Nakupenda
            became the number two trending video in Kenya just five days after it’s release while Move, their latest
            release has become a big club banger anthem in the country. The single which is their first dancehall
            release has gotten a very warm reception from the fans and is also getting airplay in the East & West
            African regions. With Number One (their 2017 hit song) still topping the charts in various platforms, LE
            BAND is gunning to be an unstoppable force within musical circles. Their follow up track – For You, did not
            match up to the extremely impressive numbers of Number 1 but was still punching with the heavy weights and
            is every bit the emotional roller coaster traditionally expected of boy bands. All in all their discography
            reeks of impending stardom and legendary status in both continental and global music leagues. Le Band has an
            explosive energy on stage when it comes to live performances which has seen them perform at Koroga festival
            alongside Kidum & Diamond Platinumz. It was also one of the few Kenyan acts during the R&B star's Omarion
            live concert in 2017. Le Band has also shared a stage with their mentors Sauti Sol at the Go Down Arts
            Center, and have headlined during PAWA Festival, Cake Art Affair among many others and hope to perform on
            bigger, global platforms in the future.
